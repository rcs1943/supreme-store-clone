				In April 1994, Supreme opened its doors on Lafayette Street in downtown
				Manhattan and became the home of New York City skate culture. At its core
				was a group of neighborhood kids, New York skaters, and local artists who
				became the store’s staff, crew, and customers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Supreme grew to embody downtown culture, and play an integral part in its
				constant regeneration. Skaters, punks, hip-hop heads — the young counter
				culture at large — all gravitated toward Supreme.
			</p>
			<p>
				While it developed into a downtown institution, Supreme established itself
				as a brand known for its quality, style, and authenticity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Over 25 years, Supreme has expanded from its New York City origins into a
				global community; working with generations of artists, photographers,
				designers, musicians, filmmakers, and writers who defied conventions and
				contributed to its unique identity and attitude.
